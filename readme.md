-   The main code file for all analyses is `analysis.R`.
-   This file imports utility functions from `utils/utils.R`, specifically the `calculateSMDs` helper.
-   Results, including all plots provided in the paper, are saved in `results`.
-   Analyses are based on the ["Depression: Psychotherapy vs. Control"](https://docs.metapsy.org/databases/depression-psyctr/) and "Depression: Psychotherapy vs. Antidepressants" databases, which are part of the [Metapsy](https://metapsy.org) project.
